This is a remote Dwarf Fortress playing software. Or at least will be. Right
now it is merely a curiosity of early development where ideas are explored and
nothing actually works yet.

Heavily work-in-progress. The current plan is to finish the web
interface so that Dwarf Fortress can be played.

    src/              Haskell source code
    web-interface/    HTML, JavaScript and other client-side files needed for
                      the web interface.
